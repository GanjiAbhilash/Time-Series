    "\n",
    "DeepAR is a supervised learning algorithm for forecasting scalar time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "A main charactersistic of DeepAR is that it can work on multivariate and multiple time series. It is in that regime where DeepAR outperforms classical forecasting methods. The training input for the DeepAR algorithm is one or, preferably, multiple target time series that have been generated by the same process or similar processes. Based on this input dataset, the algorithm trains a model that learns an approximation of this process/processes and uses it to predict how the target time series evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "GluonTS’s pre-built DeepAR estimator (`DeepAREstimator`) implements an RNN-based model, close to the one described in [Salinas et al. \"DeepAR: Probabilistic forecasting with autoregressive recurrent networks.\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the available parameters of the DeepAR estimator are: \n",
    "\n",
    " * `freq` – Frequency of the data to train on and predict\n",
    " * `prediction_length` – Length of the prediction horizon\n",
    " * `trainer` – Trainer object to be used (default: `Trainer()`)\n",
    " * `context_length` – Number of steps to unroll the RNN for before computing predictions (default: `None`, in which case `context_length = prediction_length`)\n",
    " * `num_layers` – Number of RNN layers (default: 2)\n",
    " * `num_cells` – Number of RNN cells for each layer (default: 40)\n",
    " * `cell_type` – Type of recurrent cells to use (available: `‘lstm’` or `‘gru’`; default: `‘lstm’`)\n",

    "As mentioned above, DeepAR, as well as other neural-based forecasting architectures, works really well with multivariate data. A global model is built by using **multiple time series** which are slightly different among them but are otherwise the product of the same generating process. \n",
    "\n",
    "This property finds application in many real world scenarios. In the Amazon case, we might want to forecast sales for each one of the millions of products in the Amazon catalog. It is almost certain that each product will sell with a different pattern, but we can still use information from existing similar products to predict sales for a new one. This solves the so-called cold-start problem in a manner that classical, local-model forecasting approaches can not.\n",
