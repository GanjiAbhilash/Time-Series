    "### Time Series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series consists of data points indexed in time order, typically encoding a **collection of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time**. As our world gets increasingly instrumented, sensors and systems are constantly emitting a relentless stream of time series data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple domains benefit from the analysis of time series data, such as weather forecasting, economic indicators, patient health evolution, server metrics, application performance monitoring, network data, sensor data, events, clicks and many other types of analytics data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is the core data manipulation and analysis library for Python and it has some highly useful utilities for dealing with time series data. In this notebook we will show some of what Pandas can do with time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GluonTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Gluon Time Series [GluonTS](https://ts.gluon.ai/) is the Gluon toolkit for probabilistic time series modeling, focusing on deep learning-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "GluonTS provides utilities for loading and iterating over time series datasets, state of the art models ready to be trained, and building blocks to define your own models and quickly experiment with different solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "With GluonTS you can:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Train and evaluate any of the built-in models on your own data, and quickly come up with a solution for your time series tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use the provided abstractions and building blocks to create custom time series models, and rapidly benchmark them against baseline algorithms.\n",
    " \n",
    "Take a look at the [GluonTS original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05264) for more details on this library.\n",
